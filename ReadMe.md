Wireless Pentest Hacking Notes
==============================

-- Not much formating in this this as Markdown is tedious to write, but it is what it is.. Thats the beauty of free.. 

-- Added in command line usage and configuration information for useful wireless pentest operations

If your on a wireless pentest feel free to pull this down as a reference

If you are new to wireless and need training I could suggest the following: 

Free WIFI Challenge Labs Which Cover Most Scenarios: 
-----------------------------------------------------

Benefits:  
1. No need for hardware its virtualized
2. WPA2 and WPA3
3. Enterprise MGT and Personal targets PSK
4. Walkthroughs with advanced Relay attacks and more

Negatives:
Walkthroughs are nice but they are not going to "Teach" you things.. Pair this with the below training optons


Two Training options I would suggest:
-------------------------------------
If you are new to wireless and looking for training I would suggest one of the following depending on your situation.. 



***Pentester Labs Bootcamp course:***
-------------------------------------
Best class I have seen for wireless pentest and packet inspection: 

Benefits of this course:
1. Its really cheap and it covers more material in depth then any other course
2. Covers Enterprise attacks and the WPA3 SAE standard
3. Has built in labs within Attack Labs to give you hands on without owning equipment

Negatives:
Really cant think of any... Other then there will be no updates since INE bought them, and INE sucks.. 



***Sans 617 Wireless:***
------------------------
This is a pretty solid class overall for wifi pentesting for beginners if you company will pay for its obnoxious cost, or you can snag used booked off ebay and couple it with the wifichallenge labs above.. 

Benefits: 
1. Covers a lot of material and is up to date
2. Also covers other things like BLE or RF Sub GHZ if your interested in that stuff and want a jump start into that world

Negatives:
1. You will need to setup labs and use your own hardware
2. Doesn't go as into detail of things as it should for the substantial cost
