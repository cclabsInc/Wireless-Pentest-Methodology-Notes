WIFI Hacking Repo Notes: 

Note: Will add to this a bit over time.... 

So first off this repo has mostly the commands and tools to perform a manual WIFI based penetration test.. 
- You should already have an idea how this works and this will save you time hunting down commands for everything
- You need to use the sniffing to profile your enviorments and hop to the relevant sections for attacks based on your intial analysis. 
- Also note to sniff accross all bands!! See Sniffing as just running airodump in a default state is only on 2.4... 
- Commands are generally all manual and not using airmong as that usually breaks things.. and its important to actualy know your interface commands

Currently does not cover things like attacking clients as this is often out of scope on engagements... 
However might be useful to add somee stuff regarding that and captive portals in the future.. 
If you have a writeup for that which is working propertly feel free to submit it.. I will review and add as long as its organized..
