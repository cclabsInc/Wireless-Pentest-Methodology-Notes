With OWE on WPA3 you get encryption with an open network using Dephie Helman

- Authentication
- Association  DH exchange
- Then 4 way handshake

This is susceptible to MITM due to not validating access points..

Downgrade Attack: 
------------------
If WPA transition mode is enabled it will allow non WPA3-SAE devices  to connect using WPA2-PSK, we can use this in a downgrade attack of normal 4-way handshakes. 

You can look at a beacon frame in the Auth Key Management field it will list both SAE 
	1. If the AP supports WPA2-PSK and WPA3 you can wait for a WPA2 only supported user and capture their handshake.. 
	2. Create a WPA2-PSK honypot AP with the same SSID, wait/force client to connect and then capture the 4-way handshake
	3. Then Crack the Handshake as normal
