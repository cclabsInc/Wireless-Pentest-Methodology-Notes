-- Added in command line usage and configuration information for useful wireless pentest operations

***Training:*** 
If you are new to wireless and looking for training I would suggest one of the following depending on your situation.. 

Pentester Labs Bootcamp course:
-------------------------------
Best class I have seen for wireless pentest and packet inspection: 

Benefits of this course:
1. Its really cheap abd it covers more material in depth then any other course
2. Covers Enterprise attacks and WPA3
3. Has built in labs within Attack Labs to give you hands on without owning equipment

Negatives:
Really cant think of any... 

Sans 617 Wireless:
-------------------
This is a pretty solid class overall for wifi pentesting for beginners

Benefits: 
1. Covers a lot of material and is up to date
2. Also covers other things like BLE or RF Sub GHZ if your interested in that stuff and want a jump start into that world

Negatives:
1. You will need to setup labs and use your own hardware
2. Doesn't go as into detail of things as it should for the substantial cost
